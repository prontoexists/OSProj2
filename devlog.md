4/4/2025 - Read over project. Project utilizes multithreading via semaphores. Brush up on those fundamentals and libraries. Also utilizes random and time functions as well. 

4/5/2025 - Start project. Create the Tellers and their arrays (queues). Create 50 Tellers

4/6/2025 - Create Customer function with random choices. These choices spread between Depositing or Withdrawing. Coded to where the customer informs the teller of their ID as well

4/7/2025 - Today was spent mostly developing the tellers. Utilizing the random and having the customer choose between option, and coding the teller with certain responses between those 3 was extremely tedious. Utilizing the safe semaphores was also a challenge I did not expect

4/7/2025 - Finished the Teller function. Released the semaphore after using it from safes, and confirming transactions were completed through the customer.
