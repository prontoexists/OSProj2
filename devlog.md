4/4/2025 - Read over project. Project utilizes multithreading via semaphores. Brush up on those fundamentals and libraries. Also utilizes random and time functions as well. 

4/5/2025 - Start project. Create the Tellers and their arrays (queues). Create 50 Tellers. I created the semaphores for the manager, safes, and doors as well.

4/6/2025 - Create Customer function with random choices. These choices spread between Depositing or Withdrawing. Coded to where the customer informs the teller of their ID as well

4/7/2025 - Today was spent mostly developing the tellers. Utilizing the random and having the customer choose between option, and coding the teller with certain responses between those 3 was extremely tedious. Utilizing the safe semaphores was also a challenge I did not expect

4/8/2025 - Finished the Teller function. Released the semaphore after using it from safes, and confirming transactions were completed through the customer.

4/9/2025 - Finished customer function. Tried to go back and implement time delays whenever I could through the instructions. Was ultimately ran into syntax errors on some. 

4/11/2025 - Run program and confirm it conforms to specifications. We initially ran with 50 but I changed it to 10 from here to check with output.

4/13/2025 - The program wasn't crashing with 50 and all 50 customers were being served. Submission.
